# pydantic  # Removed due to compilation issues on Windows, but FastAPI might need it. Let's try installing FastAPI without explicit pydantic compilation if possible, or hope wheels exist.
# Actually, FastAPI depends on Pydantic. Windows compilation issues with Pydantic are usually solved by using pre-built wheels. 
# Attempting to add fastapi and uvicorn.
